# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeffery Diaz

Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Army veteran, and founder of **[YardWise](https://getyardwise.com)** — a production SaaS platform delivering geospatial soil intelligence to homeowners nationwide.

I specialize in building scalable, resilient systems that move from idea → architecture → production.

---

## 🚀 Founder & Lead Engineer — YardWise

I architected and built **getyardwise.com** from the ground up, including:

- Distributed microservices architecture (Node.js + Koa, Python FastAPI)
- Geospatial resolution pipeline (ZIP → lat/lng → SSURGO polygon → MUKEY → normalized soil profile)
- Integration of USDA SSURGO + ISRIC SoilGrids datasets
- Redis caching and performance tuning for sub-60s report generation
- React Native Web (Expo) mobile-first frontend
- Stripe-based monetization (subscriptions + tokenized reports)
- Deployment to Google Cloud Run with CI/CD pipelines

YardWise is a live, production system serving users across the U.S.

I am the primary engineer responsible for system design, backend architecture, frontend implementation, and cloud infrastructure.
