# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeffery Diaz

Senior Software Engineer, Army veteran, and founder of **[YardWise](https://getyardwise.com)** — a live, production SaaS platform delivering geospatial soil intelligence to homeowners nationwide.

I design and operate scalable, resilient systems that move from idea → architecture → production.

---

## 🚀 Founder & Lead Engineer — YardWise

I architected and built **getyardwise.com** end-to-end, including:

- Distributed microservices architecture (Node.js/Koa, Python/FastAPI)
- Geospatial resolution pipeline: ZIP → lat/lng → SSURGO polygon → MUKEY → normalized soil profile
- Integration of USDA SSURGO + ISRIC SoilGrids datasets into a unified soil model
- Redis caching and performance tuning to maintain sub-60s report generation under concurrent load
- Mobile-first frontend using React Native Web (Expo)
- Stripe-based monetization (subscriptions + tokenized reports)
- Deployment to Google Cloud Run with containerized builds and CI/CD workflows

YardWise is a production system serving users across the United States.

I am responsible for system design, backend architecture, frontend implementation, cloud infrastructure, and operational reliability.
